        In short, no, Java is not considered a 100% Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
         language. It includes non-object-oriented features such as primitive data types,
          static methods/variables, and procedural programming constructs. However, Java 
          is predominantly object-oriented and supports key OOP principles 
          like encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.</p></h3>
