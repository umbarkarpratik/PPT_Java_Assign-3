//Q6. What is the benefit of encapsulation in java?

public class Que6 {
//    Encapsulation is an important concept in object-oriented programming that promotes 
//    data hiding and modularity. It involves bundling data and related methods into a 
//    single unit called a class and controlling access to the data through well-defined 
//    interfaces (methods). 
//     Here are some benefits of encapsulation in Java:

// Data Hiding: Encapsulation hides the internal details of an object, protecting the 
// integrity and consistency of data.

// Access Control: Encapsulation allows you to control the visibility and access level of
//     class members, preventing unauthorized access to sensitive data.

// Code Modularity: Encapsulation organizes code into classes, promoting code 
//     organization and making it easier to understand, maintain, and extend.

// Flexibility and Evolvability: Encapsulation enables changes to the internal implementation
//  of a class without affecting other parts of the codebase, improving flexibility and 
//  evolvability.

// Code Reusability: Encapsulation promotes code reuse by encapsulating behavior within 
//     classes, making them reusable in different parts of the code or in different projects.

// API Design: Encapsulation is essential in designing well-defined and usable APIs, 
//     improving usability, readability, and maintainability of the codebase.
